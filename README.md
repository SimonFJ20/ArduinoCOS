# ArduinoCOS

This is a little project for me to learn C and C++

The goal is to:

1. write a CLI Operating System
2. design a Programming Language called "Smort"
3. write a Compiler, that Compiles "Smort" to "Smort-bytecode"
4. write a Runtime Enviroment, that runs "Smort-bytecode"

The target platform is an Arduino Uno, and therefore the code needs to be efficient, hence C.

The ambition here is as much as possible simple functionality over feature richness.

The finished product will be writtin mostly in C, and some platform specific in Arduino/C++.
